RiakStoreObjectOperation represents a store HTTP request: 
Stores an object under the specified bucket / key. 

If no key is specified, make a POST to /buckets/<bucket name>, parse the key that's auto-generated by Riak, and return it in a results dictionary.

Multiple choices and conditional request semantics are not handled yet.
