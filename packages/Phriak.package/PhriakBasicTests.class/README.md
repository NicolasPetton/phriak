Tests working against bucket "_phriaktest" on default Riak cluster at http://localhost:8098/riak. 

Note that if the Riak server is not reached, all tests fail, but this can take time because of timeouts. It is therefore wise to verify the connection by opening http://localhost:8098/riak using a web browser on the client computer.
